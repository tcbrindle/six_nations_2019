    <h1><em>Choose your own Adventure:</em> Six Nations 2019 Finale Edition</h1>
    <p>
        In the ancient city of Cardiff, beneath the roof of the mighty Principality, seventy thousand souls bedecked in
        red sing and imbibe in the tradition of their fathers, uncles and cousins. For some, these may
        even be three different people. Alongside their green-clad celtic bretheren, they all agree that it would be
        nice to win, but even better if England lose.

        Before them, the Chosen of the Cymru do battle with the mighty Warriors of the Emerald Isle. Who emerges
        victorious?
